**Pick-up service may be available if arranged at least one month prior to your arrival to Zagreb**. E-mail request to the student organisation Erasmus Student Network, info@esnzagreb.org; **Subject: I want my buddy**. The Zagreb airport is very small, just one international arrivals gate from which the [Croatia Airlines bus](http://www.croatiaairlines.com/Travel-info/At-the-airport/Airport-transport) can take you to the main bus station in the city. **Croatian students provide pick up from the bus station (NOT the airport), from 9am to 10pm.**
Join ESN Zagreb for different activities, parties, field trips and many more: facebook, search input: ESN Zagreb.
**VISA AND TEMPORARY STAY PERMIT**
**EU/EEA citizens** can enter Croatia with just a valid ID card (or passport) and then need to register at the Central police station if staying for more than 3 months to regulate the residence permit.
**Citizens of the USA, Australia, Canada** , etc. (for full list visit [**here**](http://www.mvep.hr/en/consular-information/visas/visa-requirements-overview/) _)_ can enter Croatia with a valid passport and then apply for the residence permit in Zagreb. Check with the Croatian embassy in your country of residence which documentation you will need for your application in Zagreb and make sure you take it along when coming to Zagreb.
**NON-EU/EEA citizens coming from a country that has a visa-regime with the Republic Croatia** need to apply for a visa via the Croatian embassy in their home country before departing for Croatia.
The list of countries whose nationals need a visa to enter Croatia can be found at the pages of the [**Croatian Ministry of Foreign Affairs**](http://www.mvep.hr/en/consular-information/visas/visa-requirements-overview/).
  
Visas CANNOT be applied for or extended in Croatia! Please contact the Croatian embassy in your country of residence for more information. You will receive an acceptance letter that covers some of the documentation needed for your visa application as soon as your complete application has been approved by the faculty/academy of the University of Zagreb that will host you.
The list of required documents can be found at: <http://international.unizg.hr/international_students/exchange_students/>
**HEALTH INSURANCE**  
All exchange students must have health insurance during their stay in Croatia.
All **EU/EAA students** need to bring their European health insurance card to Croatia as it will be valid.
All **non-EU/EAA exchange students** are required to register for Croatian health insurance upon arrival. Croatian health insurance is offered for currently approx. 400HRK/month (approx. 54EUR) and entitles the user to full healthcare coverage. This insurance will not cover your journey to Zagreb including medical evacuation and repatriation – please make sure you purchase travel insurance accordingly.
