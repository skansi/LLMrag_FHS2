**Description:**  
> Course objectives: develop in students scientific knowledge pertaining to the correlation between public systems and population dynamics within the framework of theoretical concept; provide students with the necessary skills to help them differentiate and understand similar scientific fields, branches, and disciplines, as well as multi-disciplinary approach to research of the dynamics between public systems and population; introduce students to relevance of population dynamics in the planning of public systems; make students competent in discovering, identifying, and defining terminology, categories, and laws within the field of demography and public systems; equip students for independent research related to the relation between population and development of public systems; equip students for application of standard and specific methods and techniques of research of correlation between population dynamics and public systems.  
**Learning outcomes:**  
  1. Recognize economic, spatial and social logics through fieldwork and application of scientific technology
  2. Recognize relevant computational and graphical methods in the process of reviewing and clarifying public-population relationships
  3. Use GIS in methodological and technical terms when solving problems.
  4. Use cartographic methods and projections in considering, clarifying and transferring the legalities of the underlying subject relationship
  5. Design a research assignment proposal
