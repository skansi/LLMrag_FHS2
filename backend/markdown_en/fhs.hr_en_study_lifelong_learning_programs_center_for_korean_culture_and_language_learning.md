The King Sejong Institute (Korean: 세종 학당; read as: Sejong Hakdang) is the name of a language institute founded by the South Korean government around the world in early 2007. The Institute is named after Sejong the Great, the inventor of the Korean alphabet. By June 2021, 234 King Sejong Institutes were established in 82 countries worldwide. The King Sejong Institute in Zagreb was opened in September 2020 at the Faculty of Croatian Studies. It currently collaborates with Chung-Ang University in Korea and receives support from the Embassy of the Republic of Korea.
The course at the King Sejong Institute is intended for those who wish to learn the Korean language and culture. The course includes four parts: speaking, listening, reading, and writing, as well as learning about Korean culture. Upon completion of the course, a certificate from the King Sejong Institute will be issued, which can be used as proof of proficiency in the Korean language when applying for a residence visa in Korea.
The program includes various cultural activities. Some of these are Korean painting, calligraphy, taekwondo, drinking green tea, ceramic art, kite flying, celebrating King Sejong's birthday, and celebrating Hangul Day. Each semester features a different cultural program.
