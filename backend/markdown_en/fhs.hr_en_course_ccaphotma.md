**Description:**  
> Course objectives is to bring closer to the students the Croatian medieval history and point out to them how the events and processes are intertwined on the Croatian and European level, in the political, social and cultural sense. The history of Croats in the Middle Ages was marked, after their arrival, by the creation of their own state, which has experienced ups and downs depending on the internal and external political factors. Uniting with the Kingdom of Hungary in a personal union (upon the arrival of the Arpad dynasty on Croatian throne) and the increasingly powerful Venetian presence on the eastern coast marked the history of Croatia during the period of the High Middle Ages, at the end of which, as a result of the Ottoman conquest, Croatia will be reduced to remnants of the remains. The underlying aim of the course therefore is to introduce to the students how these processes affected the medieval political, social and cultural development of the Croatian lands.
