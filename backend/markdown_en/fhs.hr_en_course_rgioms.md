**Description:**  
> The aim of the course is to familiarize students with types of sources, tools and methods of researching medieval history and working on sources to develop skills and competencies necessary for independent research. Attention will primarily be on different types of written sources (public and private documents, notary, city and chapter registers and protocols, legal normative documents, narrative sources), but the importance of the material culture (objects of everyday use, architecture, art works) will also be pointed out. Analysis of certain documents will be carried out in order to deepen the practical application of knowledge in traditional auxiliary historical sciences and to develop practical skills required in working with sources. Special attention will be paid to the content analysis of selected sources in order to indicate a wide range of possible research topics.
