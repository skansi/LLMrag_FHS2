**Description:**  
> Mass communication has given character to human society since its beginning, and its forms have evolved in parallel with social and technological development and had impact on the character of political relations.

The course will contain an introduction to the structure of the political process, the history of political ideas and public phenomenon as a framework for communication and legitimacy based on political decisions. The course should enable students to acquire knowledge and adoption of appropriate methods of research.
