**Description:**  
> The course objective is to acquaint students with teaching as a highly complex system of mediating knowledge and skills on three levels of teaching methodology: a) the level of teaching methodology that mediates the general theory of teaching, i.e. generally valid principles and procedures applied within various subjects and teaching situations as well as complex teacher-student-teaching environment communication relationships; b) subject specific methodology as a narrower specification of teaching procedures characteristic for a specific field or fields (e.g. humanities, social sciences), c) subject specific methodology fully concentrated on specific content and objectives of individual subjects/courses and adequate teaching procedures.
