**Description:**  
> After completing the course and passing the exam, students will understand the principles of human development and know the changes in the physical, cognitive, social and emotional development and personality development in early childhood, middle and late childhood and adolescence. Students will acquire skills that enable them to distinguish between typical development and developmental problems in children and adolescents and to identify developmental risk and protective factors at the individual, family, peer group and the wider social environment levels. Based on this knowledge, through individual work, seminars and group discussions, students will acquire the skills to plan activities to promote positive behaviour and prevent undesirable behaviour in children and youth.
