**Description:**  
> The main objective of this course is to provide insight into the basic knowledge of semiotics, with special reference to its interdisciplinary nature, understanding it as a point of blending of life sciences and the science of signs (T. Sebeok). The specific objective of the course is to prepare students to understand semiotics as a science, general semiosis and communication systems, as is reflected in the broad range - from everyday communication over a public (and mass) communication to the aesthetic structure of language, image and sound signals - in order to evolve a character into a sign and recognize opportunities of semiotic interpretation of texts of all kinds of media (print media in general, front pages, promotions, photos, music, film).
