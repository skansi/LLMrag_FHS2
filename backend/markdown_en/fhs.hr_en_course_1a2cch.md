**Description:**  
> Course objectives are to introduce students to a new stage of development of Croatian historiography in the 19th century and its gradual transformation into a scientific discipline. The material is exposed clearly and synthetically in the context of the time, but students need to learn about different approaches to the study of the past in some areas of the Croatian ethnic propagation, particularly with the major representatives of historiography in the 19th and then 20th century. In particular, attention should be drawn to new developments and modern outlier Croatian historiography in the last three decades.
