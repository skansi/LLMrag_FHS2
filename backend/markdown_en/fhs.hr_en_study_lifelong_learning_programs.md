## 
In addition to regular university study programs (educational and scientific activities), the Faculty of Croatian Studies also hosts various supplementary educational activities that contribute to the vibrancy of this higher education institution and its openness to diverse content that aids in the ongoing efforts for professional development of individuals or groups.
The educational activity of the Faculty of Croatian Studies encompasses the development and delivery of professional studies and lifelong learning programs within the scientific fields where educational and scientific activities are conducted.
Advisory activity includes providing support to students and employees in addressing personal difficulties, questions of personal development, and professional uncertainties, and may involve individual and group work, lectures, the creation of textual and visual materials, and connecting with more appropriate sources of support if needed.
The center, depending on the complexity, scope, and comprehensiveness of the tasks performed within its structure, can be an organizational unit or a sub-unit within an organizational unit, and it is involved in educational and professional work as well as the development of professional and other study programs in connection with practice.
Training and professional development programs are part of the lifelong learning system or a result of international cooperation and are flexibly structured.
