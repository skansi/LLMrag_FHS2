**Description:**  
> Political communication is one of the most important elements of the politics, which is itself based on mutual communication of individuals as well as on common knowledge that arise as a result of communication. In contrast to the idea of mass communication, which typically represents a process of targeted one-way flow of information, the concept of political communication, especially in democratic societies, includes also the interrelationship of factors in the political process and the methods and ways of conveying information. The methods of political communication reveal the true identity of a political system. The public space in its role of a place of communication and shaping of public opinion in modern western democracies becomes a sophisticated mechanism of various information transfer. In this context, the media is becoming less an instrument of media policy and more a kind of stock exchange for information and the boundary is lost between the sender and the recipient, and the participants are required to have specific skills at their disposal. Development of media brings changes in the structure of political communication and creates new political priorities.
