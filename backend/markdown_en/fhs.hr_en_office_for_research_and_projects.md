## 
The Office for Science and Projects was established to systematically monitor the implementation of project activities at the Faculty level and to provide advisory and administrative support primarily to academic, teaching, and associate staff, as well as to other Faculty employees, in project management.
In terms of scientific collaboration, the Office systematically works on achieving and enhancing high-quality and productive scientific cooperation with existing and potentially strategically significant domestic and international higher education and research institutions.
The Office also organizes and conducts educational activities related to project management in general, as well as trainings, information days, and workshops on specific topics related to individual calls, specificities, and management procedures, and other relevant topics in this area, tailored to the institution's needs.
Additionally, the Office maintains records on the status of scientific and project activities at the Faculty and archives competitive and official project documentation of the Faculty of Croatian Studies.
The Office is also responsible for regularly informing the employees of the Faculty of Croatian Studies about opportunities to participate in projects and for official communication with bodies in the project management system.
