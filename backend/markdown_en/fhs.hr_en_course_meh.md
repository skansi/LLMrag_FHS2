**Description:**  
> The main aim of this course is to provide students with basic knowledge about the medieval period, and to acquaint them with the main political, institutional, social, economic, cultural and religious medieval trends. Besides acquiring knowledge in basic data, students will be encouraged to analyse characteristically medieval processes in comparative perspective and to develop sensibility for changes that were occurring during a thousand year long period. Students will be able to perceive peculiarities of medieval society, and to detect social, religious and political continuities and discontinuities from the late antiquity to the early modern and even until modern era. The aim is, also, to elaborate medieval history topics which were insufficiently analysed in historiography and those which require new interpretations.
