**Description:**  
> The aim of the course is to analyze and explain, in a diachronic sequence, the causes and forms of resistance to various types of government in the period from the early modern period to the modern era of national history. The bearers of resistance are social, religious, political and military groups and prominent individuals. The political and social circumstances that give rise to resistance, often violence, opposed to the government due to its oppression or principled non-acceptance of that government will be analyzed. This leads to a theoretical framework for studying resistance, which also includes elements of studying the history of violence. Special attention will be paid to the critical years of Croatian history, which were marked by the disappearance of old and the establishment of new state communities, and the resistance associated with it.
