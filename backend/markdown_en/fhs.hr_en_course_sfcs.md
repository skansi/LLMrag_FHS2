**Description:**  
> The main goal of the course is to introduce students to basic statistical concepts and techniques needed for various applications in communicology. Students, through lectures, exercises, readings and autonomous problem solving learn difference between descriptive and inferential statistics, graphical and numerical display of data, calculate and estimate average values, mod, median, learn basics in probability, learn discrete and continuous probability functions, calculate and interpret variance and standard deviation, Bernoulli, binomial, uniform, exponential, standard normal and normal probability functions. Students will be acquainted with all fundamental statistical knowledge and techniques which are being used in business practice with emphasis on interpretation of statistical parameters contained in computer outputs. Students develop statistical way of thinking and learn precise statistical manner of communication. It is expected that students demonstrate clear statistical interpretation of the results.
