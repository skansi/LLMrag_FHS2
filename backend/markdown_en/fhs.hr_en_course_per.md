**Description:**  
> The course Perception introduces students to the fundamental concepts, processes, and theoretical approaches in the study of perception. The focus is on understanding how humans receive, organize, and interpret sensory information from the environment, and how these processes enable awareness of the surrounding world. Through lectures and seminars, students explore topics such as the structure and function of sensory analyzers, measurement of sensation and perception, attention, perception of form, depth, motion, and size, as well as perceptual constancies, illusions, and the subjectivity of perception. Special emphasis is placed on the relationship between stimulus and experience, and on the biological and psychological mechanisms underlying perceptual processes.  
>  The course provides a foundation for understanding other psychological processes such as learning and memory, and establishes the basis for applying perceptual knowledge across different fields of psychology.  
**Learning outcomes:**  
  1. Describe the human sensory analyzer and the formation of individual sensations.
  2. Compare different sensory analyzers with respect to stimuli, sensory organs, mechanisms of sensation, and evolutionary significance.
  3. Explain the functioning of depth perception, form perception, motion perception, and perceptual constancy.
  4. Explain the relationship between stimulus and perception.
  5. Describe the phenomenon of attention.
  6. Compare various perceptual illusions and explain the reasons for their occurrence.
  7. Analyze the subjectivity of perception.
