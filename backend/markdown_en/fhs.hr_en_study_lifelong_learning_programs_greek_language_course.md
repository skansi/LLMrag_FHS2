## 
The Greek language course is held under the organization of the Department of Croatian Latinity during the summer semester, according to the agreement with the program director, Assoc. Prof. Dr. Maja Matasović.
Upon successful completion and the final exam, students earn 2 ECTS credits for extracurricular activities.
Interested students will connect knowledge of grammar (phonology, morphology, and syntax) from the Croatian language with the same in Greek, and will identify similarities between Croatian and Greek at all levels, including lexical. Through regular exercises and work with the instructor, students will be able to read and write the Greek alphabet, transcribe and transliterate Greek words into Croatian, use reference literature, recognize basic morphological forms in texts, translate simpler texts from Greek to Croatian, and identify similarities and differences with Croatian and Latin languages.
Some of the competencies acquired through the course include:
  * Mastering the alphabet, correct reading, accentuation, and writing of words;
  * Writing Greek on a computer using the Antioch program;
  * Recognizing case forms within individual declensions, as well as recognizing verb forms;
  * Connecting with Greek heritage in the Croatian language;
  * Identifying similarities and comparing with certain morphological and syntactic structures in Latin;
  * Achieving the skill of identifying basic characteristics of Greek texts and gaining competence for independently translating simpler sentences and shorter texts from Greek to Croatian, as well as navigating (with the help of a dictionary and grammar) simpler Greek texts;
  * Knowledge of transcription and transliteration rules.
