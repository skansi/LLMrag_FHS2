       "While all teaching activities are held in Croatian, foreign students in mixed groups have the opportunity to attend additional office hours with the lecturer and teaching assistants in English to help master the course materials. The lecturer will also provide corresponding literature in English and allow exams to be taken in English. However, some courses like **History of the USA from the First Colonies to the End of the 19th Century** are not offered in English at this time.\n",
