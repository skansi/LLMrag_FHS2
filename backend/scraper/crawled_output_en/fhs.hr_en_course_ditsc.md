**Description:**  
> The content of the course enables students to interpret human behaviour using a multidimensional approach. Students will assess and evaluate contemporary research within bioecological theory framework on the impact of physical environment, culture, societal institutions, communities, families, and peers on the development of children and adolescents taking into account characteristics of individuals and their direct and indirect interaction with different levels of ecological systems. Through critical analysis of various theories and research, students will be able to assess the complexity and variety of life experiences of people and social groups in relation to the social context and environment in which they live. Students will distinguish favourable from unfavourable effects of microsystem, mezosystem, egzosystem and macrosystem on parenting and development of children and youth. Students will analyse the activities of children and youth in different microsystems, their transitions from one environmental context to another and the quality of relationships among their microsystems. Through independent and team work and discussions during the seminar on socially relevant topics, students will reassess their point of view and gain greater insight into their own values and attitudes. Upon completion of the course, students will increase their ability to participate in an interdisciplinary and team work in order to plan programs and interventions that promote positive development of children and youth.
