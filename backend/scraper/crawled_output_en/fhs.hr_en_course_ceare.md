**Description:**  
> Systematically rethink the impact of modern techniques on man and society, creating a new cybernetic, scientific and technical paradigm that lays a radically new foundation for the production of all life and the relationship of man with science and technology.   
>  By presenting the achievements of convergent technologies and artificial intelligence (AI), students want to get acquainted with the most important aspects of human cyborgisation, application of artificial intelligence and ways to create a new kind of "man" and cause changes in human natural structure and society.   
>  This raises fundamental questions such as: what is man today (descriptive aspect) and what should (normative aspect) be a human being?   
>  How does the cybernetic age change man and what will his coexistence with robots be like?  
>  Introduce students to discussions on important philosophical-anthropological and ontological definitions of man and society.   
>  Special emphasis will be placed on future visions of posthuman creation and reflection on the creation of a new scientific and technical reality of artificial intelligence, raising questions about the ethical position of these intelligences in their relationship to man, or man's relationship to them.   
>  Open the basic dilemmas of technological progress through philosophical and bioethical critical evaluation aimed at creating new post-human ethics: cyborgoethics as an important philosophical and bioethical-medical-technical reflection on the essence of human improvement and robotics as an essential consideration of the emergence of man's new mechanical counterparts - robot as a replacement.   
>  In this way, students want to be encouraged to apply ethical principles in order to fight for personal and social determination of the limits of technological achievements and their application in modern society.  
>    
>  Learning outcomes at the level of the programme to which the course contributes:   
>  ability to understand and interpret the way of origin, meaning and application of certain theories  
>  ability to understand and interpret basic concepts of cultural anthropology  
>  skills of critical thinking of international processes and processes of globalization  
>  knowledge and understanding of the field of current forms of social activity as well as the way of functioning of various forms of sociality; economic, cultural and political social processes, prevailing social values  
>  introduction to planning, organizing and conducting research  
>  skills of written and oral reporting and public presentation of content  
>  introduction and training for independent computer work in writing and processing texts, working with databases  
>  ability to act effectively, independently and in teams  
>  the ability to effectively use various methods of communicating with society as a whole  
>  ability of ethical understanding and implementation of professional ethics  
>    
>  Expected learning outcomes at the level of the course:   
>  Describe the phenomena of cyborgisation, robotisation, transhumanism and artificial intelligence  
>  Evaluate the phenomena of cyborgisation, robotisation, transhumanism and artificial intelligence  
>  Connect concepts from technology, cyborgoethics and robotics with an emphasis on the impact of modern technologies on man and society  
>  Define ethical principles in the application of artificial intelligence in modern society and its impact on man and society.  
>  Apply cyborgoethical principles in defining the boundaries between treatment and improvement.  
>  Critically look at the issues of applying artificial intelligence and improving man  
>  Assess key policy challenges for decision making, development and use of artificial intelligence and robotics in society  
>    
>  Course content:   
>  1. Introductory lecture - introduction to syllabus, course objectives, the way of working on lectures and seminars and the rules of evaluating student work.  
>  2. Introduction to paradigmatic changes in technology - a synthetic view of the connection between philosophy, technology and medicine and the definition of basic concepts from technology to understand the digital-robotic age.  
>  3. Evaluation of convergent technologies in the creation of new human characteristics in modern times - the concept of NBIC, cyborg (Kline & Clynes, Haraway), the concept of cybernetics (Wiener), the development of cyborgisation, artificial intelligence, etc.  
>  4. Settings of transhumanist anthropology - theoretical framework and techniques for improving human beings, nanotechnics, cognitive science, genetics (Harris, Savulescu, Moravec, Kurzweil, Fukuyama)  
>  5. Cyborgisation and the post-human condition - procedures and goals of cyborgisation, evolutionary-eugenic aspiration to improve man  
>  6. The body as a cybernetic system - Platonic-Cartesian dualism, the soul in the age of convergent technologies, possibilities and dilemmas (organs for exchanging information, organs for exchanging matter and energy, etc.);  
>  7. Cyborgisation of real social relations in the age of scientific humanism - society as a cybernetic organism  
>  8. Ethical issues of body improvement in sports and art - prostheses as aids in sports - morally un / justified (Pistorius case); body with implanted technical accessories - body as software and interface, computer interactive performance, posthuman and (re) production of man in computer; cyborgisation in music - a time of technoculture and simulated reality  
>  9. Ethical controversy between transhumanists and bioconservatives - advocating and opposing the use of biotechnology for human improvement  
>  10. Cyborgoetic dilemmas and principles of improvement of human beings (Habermas, Kant, Plessner)  
>  11. Resolution on the limits of improving human beings and historical reality - setting the ethical and legal responsibility of cyborgizing the overall reality  
>  12. Robots in the historical reality of scientific humanism - according to the mechanical immortality of conscious human copies, types of friendly robots  
>  13. Ethical dilemmas of the application of artificial intelligence and the possibility of developing superintelligence - the potential and dangers of artificial intelligence in research and the real environment  
>  14. Robotoethics - development of a roboticoethics framework, ie regulation of the application of artificial intelligence in modern society, laws of robotics (I. Asimov), defining the problems of autonomy, privacy, trust and responsibility (eg who or what will be considered responsible when and if the autonomous system breaks down or harm people?)  
>  15. Concluding remarks - evaluation of achievements in the case.
