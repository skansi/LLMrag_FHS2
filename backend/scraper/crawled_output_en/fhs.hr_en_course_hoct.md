They are mostly associated with the development of the dramaturgy and theatre sciences through the centuries in the connection with the analysis of specific dramatic texts as well as the theatrical performances. The studying of this subject will be concentrated in the Croatian cultural history. Participants will be introduced in various methodological problems of theater historiography and they will be trained for critical application of new approaches to contemporary theatre as well as to the history of the performing arts and their synthetic nature. Based on the structure of Croatian theater, based on the knowledge of poetics students will acquire a system of knowledge about the Croatian theater with particular insight into the history of it and its relations with other European theater, then also theatre of classical Greece to the latest achievements in this genre of literature. The course includes a working visits of the students to at least three theatrical performances or during the rehearsals. Course objectives include: acquiring of the fundamental knowledge of the theater, which will be presented as an overview of the focal points of the history of dramatic literature and also of the processes of making theatrical performances in Croatian cultural history. Acquisition of basic knowledge and skills connected with the interpretation of dramatic texts as well as theatrical context will help students to build systematic knowledge on this matter. Examples from the history of Croatian theater and drama will enable the students to consolidate their methodological approach based on chapters on the per formative dimension of dramatic texts.
