**Description:**  
> The course provides an introduction to sociolinguistics, i.e. to the study of why we speak the way we do, and the social factors that influence our linguistic decisions. Key issues of the complex interaction between language and society are explored, including register, genres, styles, code-switching, diglossia, bilingualism, language and power, language and identity, communication across cultures, language change, language policy and planning, all of which are unified by the common denominator called language variability and diversity. Considerable attention is devoted to the ways in which spoken and written language may be interpreted depending on the context and expectations of the participants.
