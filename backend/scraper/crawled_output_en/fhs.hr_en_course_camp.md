**Description:**  
> This course deals with the relationship between language and its context. Whatever we say or write has an incomplete meaning until it is embedded into a concrete situation (e.g. time, place, goal, previous events, participants). By acquiring basic notions of pragmatic theory and analysis, we shall learn how people complement the said or written words with contextual information and in this way obtain the complete message. Through discussion and workshops, we will become aware to which degree our everyday communication depends on the context, but also how manipulating the relations between linguistic and extralinguistic reality is crucial for domains such as humour, advertising, and political polemics. We wil learn how people coming from different cultures frequently understand the same utterances in different ways. Through the speecah act theory we will observe the ways in which, if certain conditions are met, language can modify reality. The theory of politeness will show us how language helps shape hierarchical social relationships.  
>  Knowledge of pragmatics will enable a better understanding of the mechanisms of verbal communication, which will help us build our own language and a critical approach to everything we hear or read.  
**Learning outcomes:**  
  1. perceive the difference between the uttered and and unuttered part of a message
  2. recognise the ways in which language can modify the reality with speech acts
  3. analyse communicational dynamics with the help of the concepts of pragmatics
  4. understand ways in which (im)politeness is realised in language
  5. give a pragmatically based explanation of phenomena traditionally viewed in the context of style, rhetorics and logical errors
