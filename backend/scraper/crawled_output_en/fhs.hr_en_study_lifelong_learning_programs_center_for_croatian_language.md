## 
Among the activities of the Faculty of Croatian Studies is the scientific-research and professional activity with a special focus on the Croatian language.
The Center for Croatian Language was established by the decision of the Faculty Council on December 4, 2020, upon the adoption of the Statute of the Faculty of Croatian Studies. It has been designated as an organizational unit of the Faculty that engages in educational and professional work and the development of professional and other study programs in connection with practice, conducts training and professional development programs in the Croatian language as part of the lifelong learning system, and prepares the undergraduate professional study program of the Croatian language.
At the Center, the Croatian standard language is taught as a means of public communication, an essential component of cultural identity, and a national means of expressing culture. Through its activities, the Center promotes interculturality and multilingualism in Europe as its identity features.
In addition to the traditional method of learning the Croatian language in university classrooms, participants at the Center learn and acquire the Croatian language by participating in various joint activities with the Center's employees.
Head of the Center: Assoc. Prof. [Antonia Ordulj](javascript:cms_mail\('aordulj','fhs.hr','',''\))
