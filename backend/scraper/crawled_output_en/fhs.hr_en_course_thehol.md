**Description:**  
> The course The Holocaust examines one of the darkest chapters in human history through sociological, historical, and ethical perspectives. Its aim is to understand the social, political, and ideological processes that enabled the emergence and execution of the Holocaust, while developing students? ability to critically analyze mechanisms of power, obedience, and systemic violence. Students will explore the roles of the state, society, and individuals in crimes against humanity, investigate the relationship between antisemitism, racism, and nationalism, and compare the Holocaust with other genocides of the 20th and 21st centuries. Special attention is devoted to the culture of remembrance, Holocaust denial, and contemporary forms of extremism. The course is based on reading key theoretical and testimonial works (Bauman, Arendt, Levi, Frankl, Matić) and engaging actively in discussions and student workshops.
