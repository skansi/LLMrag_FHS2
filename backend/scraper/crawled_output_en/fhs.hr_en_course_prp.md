**Description:**  
> Public Relations Practicum was conceived as a course which through interactive work, individual and in groups, links previously mastered theoretical and practical knowledge with the requirement of performing professional tasks in the future working environment. The practicum covers various writing skills, strategic planning, organization, practical approach to the issues of PR and simulations of real situations from the environment. The course expects active participation because it includes an introduction in which the students will be given advice on the subject and a practical part in which the students will be required to carry out exercises and simulations. The course includes a final assignment on the topic chosen by individual students. The assignment can be of any form and content which fall under the practical application of public relations. The final assignment serves as the basis of the final grade and periodical tasks are also taken into consideration for this purpose.
