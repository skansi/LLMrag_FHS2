**Description:**  
> This interactive and multimedia course begins with an overview of scientific data on climate change and its future projections as well as the debate on climate change as an epistemological and ethical question. Climate change is then addressed by linking it to the dominant model of development, introducing students to contemporary debates on the limits to economic growth, varieties of capitalism and related phenomena including inequalities, sustainability orientations, the consumer society and questions of social justice. Drawing on insights from ecological economics, political ecology and contemporary social theory we discuss alternative developmental models whose starting point are limits to natural resources.   
>  The course then focuses on the political implications of the current, ecologically unsustainable, model of development. Protests and social movements are discussed, artistic practices, as well as new public policies and political actors advocating for a turn towards sustainability. Special attention is given here to education for sustainable development.   
>  The final part of the course is dedicated to thinking about the society of the future in the framework of literature on utopias/dystopias.   
>  This interdisciplinary course draws on insights from sociology, economics, political science, philosophy and basic physical sciences in order to illustrate the complex interrelationship between the natural and the social world and identify alternative models of development.
