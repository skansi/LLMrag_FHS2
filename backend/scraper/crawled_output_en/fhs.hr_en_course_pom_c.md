**Description:**  
> The course aims to familiarize students with fundamental concepts, theories, and research within the field of memory psychology. It provides an overview of the principles and mechanisms of memory processes, as well as the basic classifications of memory systems. Upon successful completion of the course, students will acquire knowledge of the main methodological approaches to studying memory, understand different research traditions, and be able to distinguish between normative and pathological memory processes. By applying knowledge of the fundamental principles of memory and mnemonic techniques, students will be able to design and implement strategies for improving memory performance.  
**Learning outcomes:**  
  1. Define the fundamental concepts, processes, and systems of memory.
  2. Describe the main theories and models of memory and explain their core principles.
  3. Differentiate between types of memory (sensory, short-term, long-term) and explain their functions and interrelations.
  4. Apply basic knowledge of mnemonic strategies and learning techniques to improve memory performance.
  5. Analyze the relationship between attention, learning, and memory.
  6. Evaluate the influence of emotional, motivational, and contextual factors on memory processes.
  7. Compare and critically assess various theoretical models and research approaches in memory psychology, identifying their strengths and limitations.
  8. Integrate knowledge of memory processes with other psychological functions (perception, thinking, learning) to understand the broader framework of human cognition.
