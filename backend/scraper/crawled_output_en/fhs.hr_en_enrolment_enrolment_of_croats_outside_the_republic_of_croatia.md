#### Enrolment of Croats outside the Republic of Croatia for undergraduate university studies at Faculty of Croatian Studies in the academic year 2025/2026
​​The University of Zagreb has signed an agreement with the Central State Office for Croats Abroad which stipulates the issuance of enrolment quotas for Croats located outside of Croatia with the aim of returning Croats and Croatian descendants to Croatia as well as taking positive action to assist Croatian youth to stay in Croatia. The aim focuses on positive long-term demographic and economic progress as well as the positive general progress of Croatian society. The signing of this agreement occurred following the III. Plenary Session of the Croatian Government Council for Croats outside Croatia held on 10 December 2016 in Vukovar, which concluded that it was necessary to provide special enrolment quotas for younger generations of Croats outside the Republic of Croatia for their enrolment at universities in the Republic of Croatia and to provide study scholarships for members of Croatian minorities and/or Croatian emigrants.
Therefore, the Senate of the University of Zagreb has confirmed a special quota for these candidates, subsequently all faculties will conduct qualification assessments for them in accordance with the special terms of enrolment. The envisaged special enrolment quotas refer to the two categories as defined in Article 2 of the Croatian Interethnic Relations Act (NN 124/11, 16/12): to members of the Croatian minority in European countries (Republic of Austria, Republic of Serbia, Republic of Slovenia, The Slovak Republic, Romania, the Republic of Macedonia, Hungary, the Italian Republic, Montenegro, the Czech Republic, the Republic of Kosovo and the Republic of Bulgaria) and to Croatian immigrants in overseas and European countries and their descendants.
