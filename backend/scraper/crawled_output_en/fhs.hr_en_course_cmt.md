**Description:**  
> The course considers the influence of the media on the ontology and anthropology of man in today's information society as a "spectacle society".   
>  This applies to both "classic" media (newspapers, radio and television) and the Internet as a new medium.   
>  The media as carrier of messages and the produced hand of man create an image of historical notes and ethical values which, under the influence of media owners and the global influence of science and technology, change today's society and become the main driver of (re) shaping the world.   
>  In this sense, it is important to consider the current influences and power of modern media on the creation of social processes.   
>  Through the course students will be introduced to various media theories, mediology and philosophy of media (Harold Innis, Marshall McLuhan Walter Benjamin, Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer, Regis Debray, Gunther Anders, Guy Debord, Jean Baudrillard, etc.)
