**Description:**  
> The main objective of this course is to introduce students to the development of psychology, psychological knowledge, and modes of psychological thinking through the examination and analysis of the evolution of paradigms and schools of thought, as expressed in major theoretical systems and approaches in psychology. The course provides a historical overview of psychology as a scientific discipline (psychology in antiquity, its philosophical and scientific foundations) and an introduction to the main theoretical branches of psychology (e.g., developmental psychology, social psychology). It further enables students to acquire knowledge-based competencies for critically analyzing the main ?classical schools,? directions, and theoretical systems in psychology, with an emphasis on their comparison and interrelations. Students will also become acquainted with various branches of applied psychology and with the specific professional roles and workplaces of psychologists within those domains.  
>  Special attention is devoted to understanding the influence of key theoretical approaches, models, and paradigms on contemporary academic psychology, the development of psychological research, and the evolution of modern psychology as a whole.
